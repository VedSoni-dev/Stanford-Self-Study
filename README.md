# Stanford Self-Study (Repo-only)

This repo is intentionally simple: no website, no build. I organize by phases and drop my PDFs directly into each phase folder.

## Structure
- `phases/phase-1/` — Core Foundations
- `phases/phase-2/` — Intro to AI & Systems
- `phases/phase-3/` — Deep Learning Core
- `phases/phase-4/` — Advanced AI Theory & Agents
- `phases/phase-5/` — Robotics Mastery
- `phases/phase-6/` — Specialized & Math Depth

Each folder has a `README.md`. I upload my notes as PDFs here (and any related files). Suggested naming:
- `notes.pdf` — distilled notes
- `slides.pdf` — optional
- `exercises.pdf` — optional

## How I use this
1) Learn from Stanford slides/lectures.
2) Distill into a PDF and save it to the relevant `phases/phase-*/` folder.
3) Optionally jot a short log entry in that folder’s `README.md`.

## Study log (high level)
- 2025-08-11: Repo reset to minimal, phase-based structure.

## License / Fair Use
- License: see `LICENSE` in this repo.
- I respect course honor codes. My summaries are my own; I link to official materials where appropriate.
