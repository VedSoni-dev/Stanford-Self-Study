# 01 â€” Linear Regression

**Learning goals**
- Derive the normal equation and interpret terms
- Implement gradient descent and compare to closed-form solution

**Key formulas**
$$
\\theta = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty
$$

**Notebook**
- `courses/CS229/01-linear-regression/example_project.ipynb`

**Reflection**
- Normal equation is fast for low-dim problems but scales poorly; GD more flexible.
