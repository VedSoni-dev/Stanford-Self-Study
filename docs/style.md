# Style Guide

- **Voice:** concise, first person, active.
- **Math:** KaTeX via `$...$` or `$$...$$`.
- **Code:** prefer minimal, executable snippets over long listings.
- **Figures:** put images in `docs/assets/images/` and reference with relative paths.
- **Attribution:** link official course pages at each course index.

Example inline math: $J(\\theta)=\\frac{1}{2m}\\sum_i(h_\\theta(x^{(i)})-y^{(i)})^2$
