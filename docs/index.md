# Stanford Self-Study

This is a curated, applied learning journey through Stanford AI/ML/Robotics courses.

**Principles**
- Distill → Keep only what’s essential
- Apply → Every concept gets a runnable example
- Reflect → Short weekly notes on what changed in my understanding

> ⚠️ I don’t host copyrighted PDFs here. I link to official course pages and write my own notes and solutions.

## Start here
- Read the [How to Use](how-to-use.md)
- Browse **Courses** in the left sidebar
- Check the repo’s `courses/` for raw notebooks/code
